##Information

You can watch our first prototype in action [here](https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1381318128827224&set=vb.1378883359070701&type=2&theater)
During the These Days Hackathon 2014, the team comprised of above members successfully managed to map Kinect gestures to an infrared remote controlled helicopter using an Arduino Uno as the controller. This won us the first prize out of a pool of very creative ideas and projects by our fellow students.

We had 24 hours to build this up from scratch and were close to giving up due to the complex nature of making all these individual technologies and components communicate with one another, yet managed to get it working as a whole a few hours before the final signal was given.

## Created using

- Microsoft Kinect for Windows (devkit 1.7)
- Arduino Uno
- Syma S107 RC Helicopter
- A lot of elbow grease, sugar and junkfood

### License

The license for the Csharp code can be found under its respective directory. It was based on [this project](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/Simple-Gesture-Processing-097c5527) over at the Microsoft dev center.

For the Arduino code we didn't supply a license as it's mostly based on our own code and developments.
